                Accessories give more importance to your personal style, taste and preferences. 
                They also offer unlimited opportunities for clothes, helping you to do the best of each item you have.<br><br>
                Clothes take up more space physically in your closet and clothes,
                 but accessories are important details to complete each appearance.

              <p> While we don’t fundamentally change, our personalities do get polished as we age and accessories can show that off perfectly.
                   I may no longer wear the same kitschy necklaces but I do have an everyday necklace that has become a part of my “image”.</p>

              <p>Since I spend most of my days writing at home, I tend to keep my outfits fairly simple. Usually, weather permitting,
                   I can be found in short and a t-shirt. Since I don’t go out much, I only have one or two dresses for special occasions.
                    Both pieces are fairly simple but I can make them look completely different just by changing up the accessories. Statement earrings,
                   necklaces or even a large cocktail ring and
                    right away your eye is drawn to that item instead of my dress.</p>

        A fashion accessory is an item used to contribute, in a secondary
         manner, to the wearer's outfit, often used to complete an outfit and chosen to specifically complement the wearer's look.
         It has the capacity to further express an individuals identity and personality as there are accessories that come in different, shapes,
         sizes, hues etc. The term came into use in the 20th century.</p>

    <p>
        Fashion accessories can be loosely categorized into two general areas: those that are carried and those that are worn.
         Traditionally carried accessories include purses and handbags, hand fans, parasols and umbrellas, wallets, canes, and ceremonial swords.
          Accessories that are worn may include jackets, boots and shoes, cravats, ties, hats, bonnets, belts and suspenders, gloves, muffs, necklaces, bracelets, watches, 
        eyewear, sashes, shawls, scarves, lanyards, socks, pins, piercings, rings, and stockings<br>The type of accessory that an individual chooses to wear or carry to complement their outfit can be determined by several factors including the specific context of where the individual is going. For example, if an individual is going to work their choice of accessory would differ from someone who is going out to drinks or dinner; thus depending on work or play different accessories would be chosen. Similarly, an individual's economical status, religious and cultural background would 
        also be a contributing factor.
